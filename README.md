♻️ Waste Classification Using YOLOv8
This project is a waste classification system built with Python and YOLOv8. It identifies different types of waste (such as plastic, metal, paper, organic, etc.) from images, helping automate the sorting process and promoting better recycling habits.

🚀 Features
Real-time waste classification using YOLOv8 object detection.
User-friendly Streamlit interface for image uploads and live predictions.
Supports multiple waste categories.
Custom-trained YOLOv8 model with optimized weights.
Visualizes detection with bounding boxes and labels.
🛠️ Tech Stack
Python 3.8+
YOLOv8 (Ultralytics)
Streamlit (for the web app)
OpenCV (image processing)
PyTorch (for deep learning backend)
